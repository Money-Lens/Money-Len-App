# Money Lens Project Proposal
### Vision:
Money Lens is a web application that will simplify interpreting and organizing personal finances by providing tools for tracking income, spending, and financial goals.
### Project Summary:
Our goal is to simplify finance management by providing users with intuitive methods of viewing and interacting with their banking information.This project aims to make managing money a simple and stress-free process. Users will be able to view and interact with their transactions, including both income and expenditures. 

The application will allow users to import their financial statements, either by connecting their bank account or by uploading them manually. Connecting a bank account allows for automatic updates on real-time transactions, while manual import allows for flexibility and the ability to add statements that may not be associated with the userâ€™s bank. Once imported, users can categorize, edit, add, or delete transactions as well as view analytics about their finances. Analysis tools will include financial summaries by month, year, or a custom time period. Transaction categories will allow users to better understand where specifically their money is going.

Our primary stakeholders are users who would like to better manage and understand their personal finances. This could include individuals, or families who wish to see all of their financial information in one place.

The application will be considered a success if it is functionally capable of importing 1000 transactions spread across 100 users within a minute. This will ensure that the system can manage the large quantity of data that is likely associated with existing bank accounts.
